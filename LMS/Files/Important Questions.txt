86. ExecuteReader, ExecuteNonQuery and Executescalar in ADO.NET
	--ExecuteNonQuery-> is used to perform DML commands of SQL on data source and table. It does not return any vakue other than the rows that are affected due to it.
	--ExecuteReader-> It is used to perform the SQL commands and as such return the result to the SQL commands as an array of DataSet.
	--ExecuteScalar-> It to execute SQL commands and as per return a single value for the result.

87. Using keyword:
	1. In general the 'using' keyword is used to connect/add the namespace so as to make the methods and classes accessible 
	2. It is also used for the Garbage Collection and clearing up of object.
	3. It can also be used	 close the methods that are used or being used.
88. What is SQL Helper?
	It is a predefined class in SQL that contains the code to provide with the codes of various methods and connections making it easy for program to write a code.

89. Data Adapter:
	1. It acts as a bridge between Data Source and Data Set
	2. Used to fill Data Set and update Data Source.

90. Data Set:
	1. It is used to access data independently from the data source and may contain one or more data table
	2. It can operate with or without a connection establishment and can be used accordingly.
	3. Allows the data to be manipulated as it catches data locally
	4. It interacts with data dynammically
91. DataReader:
	It provides the same features but only when their is a connection that also provides an increase in the performance.

92. ADO.NET SqlConnection Class:
	It is used to establish an open connection to the SQL Server database. It is a sealed class so that cannot be inherited. SqlConnection class uses SqlDataAdapter and SqlCommand classes together to increase performance when connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database

93. ADO.NET SqlDataReader Class:
	This class is used to read data from SQL Server database. It reads data in forward-only stream of rows from a SQL Server database. it is sealed class so that cannot be inherited. It inherits DbDataReader class and implements IDisposable interface.

94. ADO.NET SqlCommand Class
	This class is used to store and execute SQL statement for SQL Server database. It is a sealed class so that cannot be inherited.

95. ADO.NET DataSet
	It is a collection of data tables that contain the data. It is used to fetch data without interacting with a Data Source that's why, it also known as disconnected data access method. It is an in-memory data store that can hold more than one table at the same time. We can use DataRelation object to relate these tables. The DataSet can also be used to read and write data as XML document.

96. ADO.NET DataAdapter
	The DataAdapter works as a bridge between a DataSet and a data source to retrieve data. DataAdapter is a class that represents a set of SQL commands and a database connection. It can be used to fill the DataSet and update the data source.

97. ADO.NET DataTable
	1. DataTable represents relational data into tabular form. ADO.NET provides a DataTable class to create and use data table independently. It can also be used with DataSet also. Initially, when we create DataTable, it does not have table schema. We can create table schema by adding columns and constraints to the table. After defining table schema, we can add rows to the table.
	2. We must include System.Data namespace before creating DataTable.
98. Lock
	Lock is acquired when any process accesses a piece of data where there is a chance that another concurrent process will need this piece of data as well at the same time. By locking the piece of data we ensure that we are able to action on that data the way we expect.
99. Block
	Block (or blocking lock) occurs when two processes need access to same piece of data concurrently so one process locks the data and the other one needs to wait for the other one to complete and release the lock. As soon as the first process is complete, the blocked process resumes operation.
